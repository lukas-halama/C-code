# C

This repository documents my progress as I learn the C programming language from scratch. Each `.c` file represents a new concept or a completed exercise from my practice list.

## About This Repository

The main goal is to have a public record of my progress and a collection of all the small programs I've written. The code starts with "Level 0" basics (like I/O and variables) and will gradually move toward more complex topics.

## How to Compile and Run

All programs are written in standard C. You can compile and run any of them using a C compiler like **GCC**:

```bash
# Compile the program (e.g., voting_age.c)
gcc voting_age.c -o voting_age

# Run the compiled executable
./voting_age
